        <div class="faqAnswer">
          <p>
            Yes, you can. Reservations can be placed directly through our reservation page. When you book a reservation at our restaurant, you  reserve a private dining room for two hours. This policy enables us to accommodate larger parties (up to 18 people), who otherwise may not fit in our regular dining area due to space limitations. Please understand that reservations should be booked at least  two weeks in advance to provide us ample time to approve your request. Cancellation fees <i>do</i> apply.

      <button class="faqButton">
        Why does the takeout menu have fewer items than the regular menu? 
      </button>
      <div class = "faqAnswer">
        <p>At Flourish, quality and freshness are at the heart of everything we serve. Some menu items are best enjoyed fresh from our kitchen and may not be suitable for takeout. However, we know that online ordering is a convenient option for many of our guests. That’s why we’ve carefully selected our most popular dishes for our online menu, ensuring Flourish's famously bold flavors are always available to our customers.
