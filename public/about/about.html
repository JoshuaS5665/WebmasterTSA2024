      During the year 2024, our co-founders John Smith and Jane Brown were
      individuals who sought to pursue a healthier lifestyle by incorporating
      vegan and vegetarian dishes in their diets. Noticing that many restaurants
      specializing in this cuisine sourced their produce from
      <b>major produce retailers</b> who pose insurmountable competition to
      local farms and who sometimes <b>employ inorganic practices</b> like
      pesticide and GMO use, they decided to create Flourish, a restaurant that
      not only <b>provides delicious meals</b> but also develops business
      connections with farms <b>based exclusively in Western Pennsylvania</b>,
      where they are from. Since then, they have hoped to spread their wings and
      to reach out to as many customers as possible, bearing the purpose of
      showcasing
      <b>the value of locally-based, organic, and exquisite dining.</b>
