      In 2024, John Smith and Jane Brown wanted to change their lifestyle and to
      follow the <b>increasingly popular vegan and vegetarian diet</b>. In
      searching for local vegan and vegetarian restaurants with seasonal,
      organic offerings, they noticed that many restaurants specializing in this
      cuisine rely on produce from <b>major grocery chains</b> that employ
      inorganic practices like
      <b>pesticide and Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) use</b>. That is when
      John and Jane decided to create Flourish, a
      <b>farm-to-table fine dining restaurant</b> whose roots are based in the
      organic farms of their Western Pennsylvanian birthplaces. Since then, they
      have hoped to spread their wings and to reach out to as many customers as
      possible, showcasing the value of
      <b>locally-based, organic, and exquisite dining</b>.
